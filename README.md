## Features-

- Allow users to browse food items.
- Allow users to place orders.
- Allow admin users to manage orders.

## Architecture-

The food delivery app is built using the MERN stack. The app consists of several components, including the Home screen,My Orders screen, Cart screen, Login and Logout screen and Admin screen. 

The Home screen displays the list of food items, and includes a search bar and number of items to be ordered options.The Home screen displays the list of items in the menu, and allows the user to add items to their cart. The Cart screen displays the list of items in the user's cart, and allows the user to place an order. The Order screen displays the details of the user's order.The Admin screen displays the management interface for menus and orders.

## Design-

The design of the app is modern and user-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The app uses a clean and minimalist design, with a black background and simple typography. The app also uses clear and concise language, with straightforward labels and instructions.

The Home screen displays the list of food items in a grid view, with each food item displayed as a card.The Cart screen displays the list of items in the user's cart, with the total price and checkout button displayed prominently. The Order screen displays the details of the user's order.The Admin screen displays the management interface for orders and cart, with clear and intuitive navigation and controls.

<!-- The app is designed to be scalable and modular, with a clean and organized codebase. The backend API is implemented using Express.js and Mongoose, with separate controllers and models for each component. The frontend is implemented using React, with separate components for each screen and functionality.-->

## Steps to Run the App- 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
